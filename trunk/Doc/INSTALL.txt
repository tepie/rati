Install Rati - Relational Analysis Through Images
===============================================================================
The following will step you through the process of setting up the
Rati software. You will require root access to your database system
and the shell environment. 

The following are needed to setup Rati:
	* PHP 5
	* Apache HTTP 2
	* MySQL 5
	* Graphviz version 2.12
	
This document assumes all executables to the needed software above are
in your path. If not, you will need to run the commands below using 
the absolute path to the executeables. 

Filesystem Setup
===========================================
Extract the contents of the packaged application to the desired directory. The 
root of the extract contains the root of the application, and so that will be
the main directory to view this application.

Lets assume you want to have Rati navigatable in the following fashion:

	http://localhost/rati

Where localhost is the machine name, and rati is the root directory of the package. 
Select the location of your installation, for example: /home/rati/rati-0.0-0/

Extract the package to this location:
	$ unzip rati-0.0-0.zip -d /home/rati/rati-0.0-0/
	
Apache HTTP Alias (If Needed)
===========================================
If you require an Apache HTTP alias to reach your installation directory, add the following 
to your Apache HTTP configuration file. This is likely httpd.conf.

	Alias /rati/ "/home/rati/rati-0.0-0/" 

	<Directory "/home/rati/rati-0.0-0/">
	    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
	    AllowOverride all
	        Order allow,deny
	    Allow from all
	</Directory>

Restart your Apache HTTP service for this to take affect.
