Relational concept documentation.

= Goal = 
The goal of this relational concept is in order to describe the connection of anything, similar to a graph.

= Objects =
All things stored are objects. Object are anything. Each object has an ID and a unique name to be treated somewhat like a URI.

= Attributes =
Attributes describe objects. For example, address, phone number, e-mail address may be attributes of a person. The values of these attributes are not attributes, but relationships. 

= Relationships = 
Relationships describe a value of an attribute on an object. 

== Textual == 
Relationships can be textual, meaning the value of the relationship is through text. For example, my phone number is a textual value that can describes me.

== Referencing == 
Relationships can be referencing, meaning the value of the relationships is through another object. For example, if I am a person as an object, and I am a friend of another person, that friendship is described via a physical connection to that other person.
