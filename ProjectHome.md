**Rati** is a visual way to see your data. Using various tools, data can be connection in any way to show relationships. To understand those relationships better, this tool presents it visually. Rati demonstrates the connection between **things** via **relationships** and allows you to navigate the relationship structure.

When it comes to understanding your information, lengthy documentation and explanations are good for research and in depth analysis. Full detail is a major requirement in many areas such as legal and regulatory. Other times, just the basics are needed, a very high level understanding for the start of basic conversation on how the world works and connects.

The visual perspective of information and its relationships in rati is a strive to share, at a common level, visuals of  connected information and the basic definitional meaning of these connected objects. Rati can do much more, storing any number of relationships and annotation values, but the basics will likely do because of the use of images. A relational map speaks a thousand words (just like any other picture). How you explain something in words using language to another person may not entirely make sense since you are likely familiar with the concepts and the way they are used. An image helps portray that concept visually along with words making it easier to share ideas and reality with people.
